# Project Objective: Insights

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of airplane crashes from 1908 to 2023. The insights derived from this analysis are categorized into six main areas:

1. **Temporal Analysis:** Discernible trends in airplane crashes over the years were identified, with certain periods showing a higher frequency and severity of incidents. These trends could be attributed to various factors such as advancements in technology, changes in aviation regulations, and global events.

2. **Geospatial Analysis:** Certain geographical regions emerged as hotspots for airplane crashes. The distribution of incidents varied across different regions, possibly due to factors like air traffic density, terrain, and weather conditions.

3. **Operator Performance:** The safety records of operators and airlines varied significantly. Some operators had higher incident rates, indicating a need for improved safety measures and protocols.

4. **Aircraft Analysis:** Specific types of aircraft were more frequently involved in incidents, suggesting potential areas for further investigation.

5. **Fatality Trends:** Trends in passenger and crew fatalities were explored. Certain factors were identified that contributed to fatalities, providing valuable insights for enhancing safety measures.

6. **Route Analysis:** Certain flight routes exhibited a higher likelihood of incidents. This could be due to factors such as route complexity, weather conditions, and air traffic.

Each of these areas provides a unique perspective on the factors contributing to airplane crashes, offering valuable insights that can aid in improving aviation safety and reducing risks. The interactive visualizations created using Power BI make the analysis accessible and understandable to a wide audience, from aviation experts to the general public.
